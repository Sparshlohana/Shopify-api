// Types of Apps on on shopify
// There are 3 types of apps to your Shopify store:
// 1. Public App
// 2. Custom App
// 3. Private App

// 1. Public App
// Public apps are of 2 types:
// a. Listed
// b. unlisted
// Listed apps can be installed from Shopify App Store while unlisted apps doesn't appear in the Shopify App Store result or categories. You can install unlisted apps from App Store listing or the developers website.


// 2. Custom App
// Custom apps are built exclusively for you shopify store and they are not listed on the shopify app store.
// They can be used to add features to your shopify admin or to extend your online store to other platforms using custom storefront.

// The app developer can make a custom app for you without needing API access to your store and access your shopify admin. You can install a custom app by clicking the link provided by the developer.

// If you are working with the developer you trust, or if you are making your own custom app, then you can also create and install a custom app in shopify admin.


// 3. Private App
// Private apps are only available on your store and are not listed in Shopify App Store.

// If you are working with the developer, then you need to give them API access to your store and access your shopify admin. If you don't feel comfortable giving access to the developer, then consider making a custom app.

// Additional
// Draft App
// Draft apps are used by Shopify Partners during development, and can only be installed on development stores for testing purposes.
// Installing a draft app on a development store disables store transfer permanently.

//  Draft apps can be installed on your store after Shopify reviews them, or after they are converted into custom apps.
